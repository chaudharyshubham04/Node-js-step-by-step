Installing Node
To install Node on your machine, go to https://nodejs.org and click on the Download button. Depending on your computer's platform (Windows, MacOS or Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded.
As an example, on a Mac, you will see the following web page. Click on the Download button. Follow along the instructions to install Node on your machine. (Note: Now Node gives you the option of installing a mature and dependable LTS version and a more newer current version. You can install the current version. I will use this version in the course.)


Note: On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH during the installation steps.

Verifying the Node Installation
Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with admin privileges.
To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the following at the command prompt to check for the version of Node and NPM

node -v
      
npm -v

Conclusions
At the end of this exercise, your machine is now ready with the Node installed for further development.
